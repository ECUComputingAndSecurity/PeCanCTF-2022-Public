# Tickets please writeup 

- need to fully explore the website to gain a basic understanding of how it works
- uses a JWT token as a method of authorisation
    - can be inferred from the token provided in the "tickets" page (given in plaintext or in the HTTP response)
    - or from the hints given on the main page (talk to warden)
- HS256 is vulnerable if configured poorly or with a weak, bruteforcible key
    - hint from warden suggests bruteforcing HS256
    - HS256 can also be inferred by decoding the JWT
- can run a tool such as hashcat against a valid token (received from "tickets" page) using a JWT wordlist
    - wordlists can be found online
    - there is also a JWT wordlist commented out in the source code of the home page as a hint that can be found
    - e.g., `hashcat -a 0 -m 16500 <jwt> <wordlist>`
- **mylittlesecret** is the secret key
    - use this key to forge a JWT in which the `conductor` attribute of the JWT is now True
        - i.e., `{"conductor": false...etc}`
- use the forged token to gain access to the "conductor's seat", and avoid getting shaken down by eshays :)
    - will need to set the cookie as the new JWT somehow
    - can be through web browser dev tools or burp suite
    - request should have: `Cookie: jwt= <forged jwt>`
- GG!
